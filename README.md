# AdvertisementAPI

This API uses JWT Authentication so to use it you have to authorize yourself first via the login.

Use either, UserName: fabian_admin, Password: 123 or UserName: fabian_user, Password: 123, to authorize yourself to login. The user can only use get requests, while the admin can use all api calls.
